TCP Socket Server & SMTP Email Sender in Python
Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Python-based system that integrates TCP socket communication for real-time client-server interactions and SMTP-based email sending with attachments. It serves as a foundation for learning networking concepts, client-server architecture, and secure automated email communication using Gmail’s SMTP server.

Features

1.TCP Socket Server
2.Accepts connections from clients.
3.Receives messages and sends modified responses.
4.Demonstrates real-time, connection-oriented communication.

SMTP Email Sender
1.Send emails securely via Gmail using App Passwords.
2.Supports multiple attachments.
3.Handles authentication errors, network errors, and invalid recipients gracefully.

Technologies Used
1.Python 3
2.Libraries:
a)socket – for TCP communication
b)smtplib – for sending emails via SMTP
c)email – for constructing emails with attachments
Gmail SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com)

Prerequisites
1.Python 3.x installed on your machine
2.Gmail account with App Password enabled
3.Required Python libraries
